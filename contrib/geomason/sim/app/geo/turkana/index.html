        Eastern Africa has undergone sustained drought for over a decade placing a great
strain on the local population. This demo introduces an agent-based model of
grazing called TurkanaSouth. The model makes use of NDVI data and monthly
rainfall data to drive vegetation growth. After describing the model, the paper
investigates the eect rainfall has on carrying capacity and how carrying capacity
varies based on initial starting conditions. I conclude that carrying capacity is
independent of initial population size.
