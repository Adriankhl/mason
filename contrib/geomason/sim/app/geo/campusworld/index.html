    The intent of this demo is to do the following:

    <ul>
        <li>Show how to read geospatial data
	<li>Have agents move smoothly along lines
    </ul>

When the simulation is started it first reads geospatial data for the George Mason University campus describing buildings, roads, and walkways.  Then 1000 agents are randomly placed on the campus walkways and begin moving along in arbitrary directions.
