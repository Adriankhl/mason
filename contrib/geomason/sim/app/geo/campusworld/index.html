<h2>GeoMASON: CampusWorld</h2> 
By Mark Coletti and Keith Sullivan
</table>
  
  The CampusWorld GeoMASON example shows how to import GIS data, and how to move agents when they are limited to paths 
  defined by the GIS data.  
  
  <p> The simulation starts by reading GIS data describing the buildings, roads, and walkways of the George Mason 
  University Fairfax campus.  All the associated attribute data from the GIS files is available through the inspectors. 
  The simulation then ranomly places 1000 agents on the walkways, and moves them around randomly.  We do this by converting 
  the walkways into a PlanarGraph, and then move the agents along segements of the graph.  When the agents reach an intersection,
  they randomly choose a new segment and continue on.
