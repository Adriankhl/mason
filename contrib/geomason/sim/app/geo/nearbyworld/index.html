    The intent of this demo is to do the following:

    <ul>
        <li>Show how to manually create Geometry objects</li>
        <li>How to add these objects to a GeomField</li>
        <li>How to create an Agent that moves in a GeomField</li>
        <li>How to do basic spatial reasoning; i.e., compute distances between objects</li>
        <li>How to use a GeomFieldPortrayal to show the objects and agent</li>
    </ul>

    When you run this demo you should see a couple lines, a filled in box, and
    a lot of dots.  One of the dots should be moving around frantically; this
    represents the Agent.  As the Agent moves through the GeomField it will
    report to stdout the objects that it is close to as well as its current
    position.
