    This demo shows how to compute geometry that touches other geometry.  A set of arbitrary polygons is displayed.  <em>Unselected</em> polygons are colored blue; one is <em>selected</em>, which is indicated by being red.  With each time step the next selected polygon is chosen from those that are touching the currently selected.
<p>
    As the simulation runs it reports to the console the currently selected polygon, those that are touching it, and which one was randomly selected.  A sample is shown below:
<p>
<code  style="white-space : pre;">
POLYGON ((15 10, 15 15, 30 15, 30 10, 15 10))
        4 adjacent shapes
                POLYGON ((10 10, 10 30, 15 30, 15 10, 10 10))
                POLYGON ((15 10, 30 10, 25 5, 15 10))
                POLYGON ((25 15, 25 25, 30 15, 25 15))
                POLYGON ((30 15, 25 25, 30 25, 30 15))
        selected POLYGON ((25 15, 25 25, 30 15, 25 15))
POLYGON ((25 15, 25 25, 30 15, 25 15))
        2 adjacent shapes
                POLYGON ((15 10, 15 15, 30 15, 30 10, 15 10))
                POLYGON ((30 15, 25 25, 30 25, 30 15))
        selected POLYGON ((15 10, 15 15, 30 15, 30 10, 15 10))
